## Project Intro/Objective
We are looking predict future military expenditures for various countries based on historical data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and related economic and geopolitical factors. By leveraging SIPRIâ€™s datasets on military spending, arms transfers, and conflict, we aim to build a time series forecasting model that can provide insights into spending trends by country and region.
